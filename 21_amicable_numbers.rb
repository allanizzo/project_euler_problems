# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
# (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are
# an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are:
# 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284.
# The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.


# basic idea is to 
# (1) list off the proper divisors and then sum them for numbers < 10 000
# (2) then to take that sum and run the same summing process
# (3) if that sum == the first sum and the numbers arent the same
# 	add it to an array for summing later

# what did we learn??
# - in the divisor_sum, you had the wrong number adding to sum
# 	^ when your in the crunch, TAKE YOUR TIME
# - if you arent clear on what the problem is asking -- CLARIFY
# 	^ you had dupes above, werent sure what "counted" as amicable
# - otherwise you did decent
