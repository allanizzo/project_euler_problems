# no timer, took a while to figure out how to process the file coming in


# solved, albeit clunky

# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a
# 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by
# 	sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical
# 	value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position
# 	in the list to obtain a name score.

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical
# order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is
# the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of
# 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

# what did we learn here?
# - could go more into importing from text files
# 	^ why you were getting garbage upon the file import
# - SORTING - you were sorting slashes at first so werent getting anywhere
	# had to clean the mess
# - you can make RANGES with letters ("a".."z") or upcase.  Make sure to have as strings.
# - i think you are really getting the hang of short, sweet methods
# - if you call "w" in a readlines or each_line, you will overwrite whats there
